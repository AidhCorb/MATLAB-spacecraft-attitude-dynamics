Plot motion of top using EOMs.

Using ODE45 to numerically solve the first order equations of motion, this project is aimed at demonstrating the
progression of instability of an unstable rigid body undergoing axial rotation in a friction free environment under the influence of gravity. Once calculated, a real time 3-Dimensional moving figure is generated to visually present the natural progression of the motion of the body, as well as separetely plotting a variety of other analytical parameters.
